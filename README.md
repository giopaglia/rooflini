# Rooflini
Do you want to draw an Intel Advisor style Roofline Analysis plot?

<div align="center"><img src="roofline.png" alt="" title="Roofline analysis plot" width="800"></div>

This is a Python script which lets you freely set:
- roofs and upper bounds (with labels);
- data points;
- plot figure aspect and ratio.

Try it out and make it your own.
